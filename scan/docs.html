	<h1>STOP SCAN </h1>
	<p>Stop scan is a free web based application that reads bus signs and gives you the next bus to arive at your stop!</p>
	<div id="htu" class="parent">
		<h2>How to use</h2>
		<p>Take a photo of the bus sign from about 1m away from the sign. Upload the photo of the sign and select the sign.</p>
			<div id="examp" class="child">
				<h3>Examples</h3>
						<p>Will work</p>
						<div id="good-exmp" class="gb">
							<img id="exmp-1" src="examples/placeholder.jpg" class="exmp"></img>
							<p>This image is nice and close & not blury. A recomended distance is about 1m (~2 steps from the sign)</p>
							<img id="exmp-2" src="examples/1508.jpg" class="exmp"></img>
							<p>This sign is near straight in the picture & the ID in the corner is easy to read.
						</div>
						<p>Won't work</p>
						<div id="bad-exmp" class="gb">
							<img id="exmp-3" src="examples/1486.png" class="exmp"></img>
							<p>This image is blury. Might have a hard time reading it.</p>
							<img id="exmp-3" src="examples/upclose.png" class="exmp"></img>
							<p>This image has already been cropped. If you upload it the application wont let you crop it out. Also it will be hard to read the sign.
