# Benja Transit
Benja transit is a free open source transit tracker. I only have a version for use in ottawa.

# Proxy.
Oc transpo decided to send a CORS header. I had to create one to fix that problem. Here is the Git repo to the proxy: https://github.com/Benjamin-del/Cors4Json

**You will have to use your own**
(It will send you the same wonky cors header)

Follow the setup instructions and you should be good to go!

# Wonky Data
The API feed has the same reliability as the busses themselves ;) Expect downtime.

# GTFS. 
Update the GTFS feed regularly.
